For a neural network with $N$ parameters, the Fisher Information is a matrix with $N^2$ entries. To illustrate how large those resulting matrices are, let's consider a network containing 3 hidden layers with a respective width of 128 neurons that gets trained on the $28\times28$ matrices of the MNIST dataset. This network has over $130000$ parameters, which results in over $10^{10}$ entries in the FI. When saving the entries as 32-bit floating point numbers, the matrix would take over 67GB of space. Calculating  this matrix in under 1 hour would require over 2 million entries to be calculated per second. Calculating the full matrix to optimize training is therefore computationally inefficient. That's why we're going to look at an equation for calculating the trace of the Fisher Information, or Fisher Trace for short, through other mathematical objects.\\
Let's first inspect the Fisher Trace by using the chain rule of derivation as
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		\mathrm{tr}(I) &= \sum_{\alpha = 1}^{N_P} I_{\alpha\alpha}\\
		&= \sum_{\alpha = 1}^{N_P} \left\{\underset{(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{y}_i) \in D}{E} \left[\tAbl{}{\theta_\alpha}\ell(f_\theta(\mathbf{x}_i),\mathbf{y}_i)\cdot \tAbl{}{\theta_\alpha}\ell(f_\theta(\mathbf{x}_i),\mathbf{y}_i)\right]\right\}\\
		&= \sum_{\alpha = 1}^{N_P} \left\{ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i = 1}^{N_D} \left[\sum_{a=1}^{N_O}\left(\pAbl{\ell}{f_\theta(\mathbf{x}_i)_a}\tAbl{f_\theta(\mathbf{x}_i)_a}{\theta_\alpha}\right)\cdot\sum_{b=1}^{N_O}\left(\pAbl{\ell}{f_\theta(\mathbf{x}_i)_b}\tAbl{f_\theta(\mathbf{x}_i)_b}{\theta_\alpha}\right)\right]\right\}\\
		&= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i = 1}^{N_D} \sum_{a=1}^{N_O} \sum_{b=1}^{N_O} \Bigg[\pAbl{\ell}{f_\theta(\mathbf{x}_i)_a}\pAbl{\ell}{f_\theta(\mathbf{x}_i)_b} \cdot\underbrace{ \sum_{\alpha = 1}^{N_P} \left(\tAbl{f_\theta(\mathbf{x}_i)_a}{\theta_\alpha}\tAbl{f_\theta(\mathbf{x}_i)_b}{\theta_\alpha}\right)}_{\Lambda_{iiab}}\Bigg],
	\end{split} 
\end{equation}
with the amount of parameters $N_P$, the amount of dataset pairs $N_D$ and the output dimension of the network $N_O$. By identifying the entries of the NTK in the last line and simplifying the notation we can rewrite the relation as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:FisherNTKRelation}
	\mathrm{tr}(I) = \underset{(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{y}_i) \in D}{E} \left[\sum_{a,b} \left(\pAbl{\ell}{f_\theta(\mathbf{x}_i)_a}\pAbl{\ell}{f_\theta(\mathbf{x}_i)_b} \cdot \Lambda_{iiab}\right)\right].
\end{equation}
Here it is important to note that there are two main parts on the right hand side: One is the loss derivative and the other is the NTK. Going further we will conduct some experiments to investigate which of those two terms is the dominant driving force in the evolution of the Fisher Trace. Specifically, we will look at the time evolution of the Fisher Trace in comparison the trace of the NTK to see how similar they evolve during training.

\subsection{Comparison of traces of NTK and Fisher Information}
To test how similar the evolution of the traces of NTK and Fisher Information are, we trained multiple networks on the MNIST dataset explained in \cref{sec:Datasets} and recorded the traces of the FI and NTK. We used networks consisting of 2 hidden layers that were equipped with the ReLU activation function. The network widths varied between $128$ and $784$. The losses used were $L_p$-Norm losses of order $n$ \cite{LpNormSource}
\begin{equation}
	d_n(f_\theta(\mathbf{x}),\mathbf{y}) = \sqrt[n]{\sum_{i=1}^{N_O} |f_\theta(\mathbf{x}_i) - \mathbf{y}_i|^n},
\end{equation}
Mean-power losses of order $n$
\begin{equation}
	d_n(f_\theta(\mathbf{x}),\mathbf{y}) = \frac{1}{N_O} \sum_{i=1}^{N_O} (f_\theta(\mathbf{x}_i)-\mathbf{y}_i)^n,
\end{equation}
and the softmax-ross-entropy loss \cite{LossExamplePaper}
\begin{equation}
	d(f_\theta(\mathbf{x}),\mathbf{y}) = \sum_{i=1}^{N_O} \mathbf{y}_i \log(\sigma_i(f_\theta(\mathbf{x}))),
\end{equation}
where we used the definition for distance $d$ from \cref{eq:DistanceLoss}, and a softmax function $\sigma_i$ from \cref{eq:softmax}.
