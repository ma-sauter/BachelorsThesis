Building on the foundations from \cref{sec:ChapterMachineLearningBasics}, \cref{sec:ChapterFisherInformation}, and \cref{sec:ChapterNTK}, this chapter presents and investigates a novel relation between the trace of the Fisher Information and the NTK in \cref{sec:Results1}. Furthermore, it provides example calculations of all previously mentioned observables for a simple 2-parameter network in \cref{sec:Results2}.
